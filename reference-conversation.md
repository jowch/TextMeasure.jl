# Is there an equivalent package for ggrepel or adjustText for julia?

There is **no direct, dedicated Julia equivalent** of `ggrepel`/`adjustText` — it's a genuine gap in the Julia plotting ecosystem. Here's the current state:

## Gadfly.jl Has It Built-In

The closest native solution is **`Gadfly.jl`'s `Geom.label`**, which has label repulsion built directly into its geometry layer. It automatically optimizes label positions to avoid overlaps and hides irresolvable ones. The downside: it hides labels rather than always finding a placement, and Gadfly has fallen out of favor compared to Makie for most use cases.[^1_1]

## Makie.jl — Manual or Roll Your Own

Makie has no `text_repel` recipe out of the box. A GitHub issue on GraphMakie.jl documents an attempt to implement a `text_repel!` recipe by porting R code, but it was never released as a standalone package. The StackOverflow thread on CairoMakie label placement describes the force-directed algorithm (attractive force to anchor label to point, repulsive forces between labels and away from other points) but leaves the implementation to the user.[^1_2][^1_3]

## Workarounds Available

- **`RCall.jl`** — call R's `ggrepel` directly from Julia. This is actually a real pattern used in the Julia community for this exact use case. Verbose, but gives you the full ggrepel behavior.[^1_4]
- **`PyCall.jl`** — call Python's `adjustText` via Julia's Python interop.
- **`TidierPlots.jl`** — a ggplot2 reimplementation in Julia (announced at JuliaCon 2024), but it does not currently include a `geom_text_repel` equivalent.[^1_5]


## Bottom Line

If you're on Makie (which fits your stack), the honest answer is you'd need to implement a simple force-directed label nudger yourself, or fall back to `RCall`/`PyCall`. Given your Julia/Makie usage, a minimal custom `text_repel!` recipe for CairoMakie would be reasonably straightforward — the algorithm is well-defined and a few dozen lines. Would it be worth me sketching that out as a Makie recipe?

# I would like to make one. Can you help me do the background research on ggrepel, textAdjust, and the GraphMakie.jl attempt? Help me understand how these packages actually work (I have some guesses but I want to ground them in facts).

Here's a thorough breakdown of how each approach actually works, grounded in source code and documentation.

***

## ggrepel: The Reference Implementation

ggrepel's core loop is implemented in **C++ (via Rcpp)** and called as `repel_boxes2()` from R. The R layer handles coordinate transformation and bounding box measurement; the C++ layer does the actual physics simulation. Here's what the algorithm does:[^2_1]

### Bounding Box Measurement (R side)

Before any physics, ggrepel measures the **actual rendered pixel dimensions** of each text label using grid's `textGrob`, `grobX`, and `grobY`. These are real typographic extents — not estimates — padded by `box.padding` (default 0.25 lines). This is critical: the boxes are computed in *native plot coordinates* (0–1 normalized), which is why labels auto-reposition on plot resize.[^2_1]

### Force-Directed Physics Loop (C++ side)

Each iteration applies three forces to every label:[^2_2]

1. **Repulsion from other labels** (`force` parameter, default 1, scaled to `1e-6`): proportional to overlap area between bounding boxes, directed along the vector between box centers
2. **Repulsion from data points** (same `force`): labels repel from their anchor point and all other data points within range, modeled as circles with `point.size + point.padding` radius
3. **Attraction to anchor** (`force_pull`, default 1, scaled to `1e-2`): a weak spring pulling each label back toward the data point it labels

The loop runs until either `max.time` (0.5s default) or `max.iter` (10,000) is exhausted, whichever comes first. The simulation is non-deterministic unless you set `seed`.[^2_2]

### Overflow Handling

Labels that overlap more than `max.overlaps` (default 10) other objects are **dropped entirely** rather than placed poorly. This is a deliberate design choice — ggrepel prioritizes legibility over completeness.[^2_3]

### Connector Lines

After placement, ggrepel computes the **intersection of the line from the data point to the label centroid with the label rectangle's edges**, then draws a segment/curve only if the distance exceeds `min.segment.length` (0.5 lines). The connection point is geometrically exact, not heuristic.[^2_1]

***

## adjustText: The Python Port

adjustText is explicitly inspired by ggrepel but takes a **different algorithmic approach**. Where ggrepel integrates repulsion and attraction simultaneously in a physics loop, adjustText uses a **two-phase strategy**:[^2_4][^2_5]

### Phase 1: Explosion

Before iterating, it does a forced **"explosion" pass** — it moves every text away from nearby texts and static objects using `force_explode`. The `explode_radius` (default: `"auto"`, based on mean text size) defines how far to look for neighbors. This pre-separates perfectly overlapping labels (which would have zero-length repulsion vectors and never move otherwise).

### Phase 2: Iterative Force Loop

Each iteration applies four distinct force categories:[^2_4]


| Force | Parameter | Default | Effect |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `force_text` | `(0.1, 0.2)` | Separate x/y | Repulsion between text bounding boxes |
| `force_static` | `(0.1, 0.2)` | Separate x/y | Repulsion from data points and `objects` |
| `force_pull` | `(0.01, 0.01)` | Separate x/y | Attraction back to original anchor |
| `force_explode` | `(0.1, 0.5)` | Separate x/y | Used in phase 1 and for random shifts |

The key difference from ggrepel: forces are **tuples with separate x and y magnitudes**, giving you anisotropic control (e.g., constrain movement to one axis). The `only_move` dict lets you restrict specific force types to only `x`, `y`, `x+`, `x-` etc.[^2_4]

### Key Implementation Differences

- adjustText operates in **display coordinates** (pixels), not normalized data units. `max_move` defaults to `(10, 10)` pixels per iteration, capping how far a label moves each step.
- `pull_threshold` (default 10px): if a label is already within 10px of its target along an axis, the pull force is suppressed along that axis — preventing oscillation near the anchor.
- Unlike ggrepel, adjustText **never hides labels**. It always finds a placement, even if crowded.
- The `prevent_crossings` option (experimental) adds a post-processing pass to untangle connector arrow crossings.[^2_4]

***

## GraphMakie.jl: The Incomplete Julia Attempt

The GraphMakie issue \#131 attempted a `text_repel!` recipe for Makie, but it was never completed or packaged. What the issue documents is essentially a **direct port of ggrepel's R logic into Julia**, using:[^2_6]

- `NetworkLayout.jl`'s spring layout as inspiration for the force formulation
- Makie's `text!` recipe as the rendering primitive
- Manual bounding box calculation using Makie's `boundingbox` on text objects

The fundamental problem that stalled it: **Makie does not expose text bounding boxes synchronously during the draw pipeline** the way ggplot2's grid system does. In ggrepel, `makeContent.textrepeltree` fires *during rendering* when grid has already measured the glyphs. In Makie, you'd need to either (a) pre-estimate bbox from font metrics, or (b) force a render pass first and inspect results — neither of which fits cleanly into Makie's `@recipe` system.[^2_7]

***

## What This Means for Your Implementation

The architecture decision you'll face first:

**Option A (ggrepel-style):** Measure real text bboxes in a `makeContent`-equivalent hook (Makie's `Observables`), then run a C/Julia physics kernel. Accurate but requires hooking into Makie's scene update lifecycle.

**Option B (adjustText-style):** Estimate bboxes from font metrics upfront (simpler, slightly wrong for variable-width fonts), run the iterative loop in pure Julia, render. Much easier to prototype.

The ggrepel approach is more correct but harder to integrate; adjustText's approach is actually a better fit for a first Julia recipe because you control the entire pipeline. The anisotropic force tuning in adjustText is also genuinely more useful than ggrepel's single `force` scalar, and the two-phase explosion + iterate structure converges faster in practice.

One blind spot to think about: **coordinate system normalization**. Both ggrepel and adjustText operate in display/normalized coordinates internally, not data coordinates. Your recipe will need to convert from data space → pixel space (or normalized Makie coordinates) before running physics, then convert back — otherwise the aspect ratio of the plot will distort your force vectors asymmetrically.

# Yeah, this tracks. Ok, the next step is to investigate whether we can calculate element bounding boxes in Makie by potentially hijacking its internals.

This is a nuanced area — there are several distinct strategies, each with real tradeoffs. Here's what the sources tell us.

***

## The Core Problem

Makie's `boundingbox` on a `text!` plot object only gives you a box over the **anchor points**, not the actual glyph extents — *when `markerspace = :pixel` (the default)*. The docs are explicit: "its extent depends on the current projection of the axis it is in". This is the fundamental pain point.[^3_1]

## Strategy 1: `boundingbox()` After Plotting (Post-Hoc)

The working approach documented in issue \#2424 is: **plot first, then query**. After a `text!` call, you can get real pixel-space bounding boxes via:[^3_2]

```julia
lbl = text!(ax, "Label", position, align=(:left, :bottom))
bb = map(ax.scene.camera.pixel_space, ax.scene.camera.projectionview, lbl) do _, _, lbl
    boundingbox(lbl)
end
```

The `map` over `pixel_space` and `projectionview` Observables ensures the bbox recomputes when the camera changes. The result is in **pixel coordinates**. You then shift the label by mutating its `position` Observable, or use `space = :pixel` for final placement.[^3_2]

**Verdict for text_repel:** This is "plot, measure, shift" — doable but inelegant. You'd render labels in a first pass, run your physics loop with pixel-space boxes, then update positions. The risk: triggering layout recomputation on every position update during the solver loop could be slow.

## Strategy 2: `string_boundingbox` Pre-Render (Internal API)

Issue \#3860 documents that Makie *does* have `string_boundingbox()` that operates on a `GlyphCollection` without needing a rendered plot. The pipeline is:[^3_3]

```julia
# Internal, not public API
gc = Makie.layout_text(str, fontsize, font, align, rotation, justification, lineheight)
bb = Makie.string_boundingbox(gc)  # returns Rect2f in font units
```

The catch, confirmed by Makie maintainer @jkrumbiegel: *"The functions to do the boundingbox calculations are all there, but they operate on `GlyphCollection` so you first need to pass your text with all its visual attributes that affect boundingboxes through the layouting algorithm."* So you need to fully specify `font`, `fontsize`, `rotation`, `justification`, `lineheight` — everything that affects glyph layout.[^3_2]

The returned bbox is in **font-metric units** (not yet in screen pixels), so you still need `Makie.project` or `Makie.scene_to_screen` to convert to pixel space.

**Verdict for text_repel:** This is the "right" path for a pre-layout solver. You can compute all bboxes upfront, run the full physics loop, and then call `text!` once with final positions. The downside: `layout_text` and `string_boundingbox` are **private, unstable API** — they've changed between versions and will change again.

## Strategy 3: `markerspace = :data`

Setting `markerspace = :data` makes `boundingbox` include actual glyph extents in data coordinates. This sidesteps pixel-space entirely. But it means your force vectors must also be in data space, which reintroduces the **aspect ratio distortion problem** — if your data axes aren't square, forces computed in data coordinates are geometrically wrong (a 1-unit displacement horizontally ≠ 1-unit vertically in screen space).[^3_1]

**Verdict for text_repel:** Only works correctly if you normalize to screen space before computing repulsion, defeating the purpose.

## Strategy 4: `textlabel` (New in Recent Makie)

Makie now has a `textlabel` plot type that internally manages text + background shape, using the text bounding box to scale a shape. Its source computes bboxes in the same `GlyphCollection` pathway as strategy 2. You can potentially read its internal bbox computation as a model, but it doesn't expose the bbox directly.[^3_4]

***

## Recommended Architecture for Your Recipe

Based on all of this, the cleanest approach is a **two-Observable pipeline**:

1. **Measure phase**: Use `layout_text` + `string_boundingbox` (internal API) to compute all label extents in font units, then `Makie.project` to convert to pixel space. Pin this behind a version check.
2. **Solve phase**: Run your physics loop entirely in pixel space. This isolates the solver from Makie internals.
3. **Render phase**: Call `text!` once with final positions using `space = :pixel` for placement or translate back to data coordinates via the inverse transform.
4. **Reactive updates**: Wrap the measure+solve+render chain in an `on(ax.scene.camera.pixel_space)` Observable so it recomputes on zoom/resize.

The biggest practical risk: `layout_text`'s signature has shifted across Makie versions (it's not public API). You'll want to version-gate it or write a small compatibility shim. The \#4729 issue even notes that `string_boundingbox` can return NaN under degenerate font conditions, so defensive checks are warranted.[^3_5]

# Tell me about textlabel

`textlabel` is a relatively new, purpose-built Makie plot type that renders text with a fitted background shape. Here's everything relevant to your use case:

## What It Does

`textlabel` plots text at given positions with a **background shape that automatically rescales to fit the text's bounding box**. This is the key detail: the background shape transformation pipeline internally computes the true glyph bounding box — meaning Makie *already has* the bbox computation you need, and `textlabel` is where it's exposed.[^4_1]

The rendering pipeline:

1. Text is laid out via the same `GlyphCollection` path
2. The padded text bbox is computed
3. A user-supplied `shape` (any `GeometryPrimitive`, `BezierPath`, or `(origin, size) -> points` function) is **transformed to fit the bbox** using `shape_limits` as the reference frame

## Key Attributes Relevant to text_repel

| Attribute | Default | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `offset` | `(0.0, 0.0)` | Shifts label from anchor in `markerspace` units — this is your primary nudge vector |
| `padding` | `4` | Pixels of space between glyph edges and shape boundary |
| `markerspace` | `:pixel` | Space in which offset and shape sizing live — pixel-space by default |
| `space` | `:data` | Space for the anchor position itself |
| `text_align` | `(:center, :center)` | Text alignment within the box |
| `keep_aspect` | `false` | Whether to preserve shape aspect ratio when rescaling to text bbox |
| `shape` | `Rect2f(0,0,1,1)` | Background shape; `(0,0)` = lower-left corner of padded bbox, `(1,1)` = upper-right |

The `shape` as a **function** `(origin, size) -> coordinates` is particularly interesting  — it means the background is computed lazily from the bbox dimensions, which implies the bbox is available as a concrete value at draw time.[^4_1]

## Why This Matters for Your Recipe

`textlabel` is architecturally your **best entry point**, not just a user-facing API. Two concrete reasons:

**1. The bbox is already computed.** The `shape = (origin, size) -> ...` callback receives `origin::Point2f` and `size::Vec2f` of the padded text bbox in pixel space. If you hijack this: you can register a shape function that **captures the bbox into an external buffer** as a side effect, giving you ground-truth pixel dimensions without calling any private API. This is a legitimate, stable-API trick:

```julia
bboxes = Dict{Int, Rect2f}()
function spy_shape(i)
    return function(origin, size)
        bboxes[i] = Rect2f(origin, size)
        return [origin, origin + Point2f(size[^4_1], 0),
                origin + Point2f(size[^4_1], size[^4_2]), origin + Point2f(0, size[^4_2])]
    end
end

# First pass: render with spy shapes to capture bboxes
for (i, (pos, str)) in enumerate(zip(positions, labels))
    textlabel!(ax, pos; text=str, shape=spy_shape(i))
end
# Now bboxes[i] is populated after the first draw
```

**2. `offset` is in pixel space.** After running your physics solver, you set `plot.offset[] = new_offset_px` to move the label. No coordinate system transformation needed — the solver works in pixels, the output goes directly into `offset`. This is cleaner than the `space = :pixel` position approach from the previous discussion.

## Caveats

- `markerspace = :pixel` (default) means the **shape and offset don't zoom/scale with data axes** — which is actually correct behavior for a text repel recipe. Labels should stay the same pixel size when you zoom. If you want labels to scale with data (e.g., for GISAXS annotation maps), you'd set `markerspace = :data`, but then your physics loop must work in data coordinates and forces become anisotropic.[^4_2]
- `textlabel` still has some rough edges — `Cycled()` for `text_color` was broken as of November 2025, so it's not fully production-hardened.[^4_3]
- The spy-shape bbox capture relies on the shape callback being called **synchronously during the first render** — true for CairoMakie (immediate rendering), but for GLMakie/WGLMakie you'd need to wait on the render Observable or use `display()` first before reading the captured values.

The shape-callback spy is probably the cleanest stable-API path for your pre-solver measurement, and `offset` is the cleanest stable-API path for post-solver placement. It lets you avoid touching `layout_text` / `string_boundingbox` entirely.

# Ok, let's sketch out the outline of what this would look like? Is there a way to insert this operation into the declarative figure spec so that it runs on render?

Good, this gives a clear picture. Here's the full architectural sketch.

***

## The Core Lifecycle Problem

Makie's `@recipe` system is **declarative and reactive**, not imperative. The `plot!` method runs *once* at construction time to wire up Observables; it does not run on every draw. This means you can't do "measure, solve, re-render" in a single synchronous pass inside `plot!`. The key insight from the docs: *"The plotting calls in your recipe should only be done once, not on every observable update. But the input observables to these inner plotting calls should be lifted from the recipe input observables."*[^5_1][^5_2]

This is both a constraint and a gift — if you model the solver as an Observable transformation, it updates reactively on zoom/resize for free.

***

## Outline: `textrepel!` Recipe

### Structure

The recipe wraps two things: a `textlabel!` call (for drawing) and a `lines!`/`linesegments!` call (for connector lines). The positions fed to `textlabel!` are **lifted from a solver Observable**, not from the raw input positions.

```julia
@recipe(TextRepel, positions, labels) do scene
    Attributes(
        # Physics
        force_text    = 0.1,
        force_static  = 0.1,
        force_pull    = 0.01,
        max_iter      = 200,
        padding       = 4.0,       # px, fed to textlabel
        # Connector lines
        draw_lines    = true,
        min_dist      = 5.0,       # px — suppress line if label barely moved
        linecolor     = :gray60,
        # Passthrough to textlabel
        fontsize      = 12,
        color         = :black,
    )
end
```


### The `plot!` Body

The tricky part is the **two-pass bootstrap problem**. Here's the approach that avoids private API:

```julia
function Makie.plot!(p::TextRepel)

    # 1. Bbox capture store — filled by shape spy on first render
    bboxes = Observable(Dict{Int, Rect2f}())

    # 2. Build spy shapes that populate bboxes as a side effect
    spy_shapes = @lift begin
        n = length($(p.labels))
        [function(origin, size)
            $(bboxes)[][i] = Rect2f(origin, size)   # capture bbox
            notify($(bboxes))
            # Return a transparent rect (no visible background in first pass)
            [origin, origin .+ Point2f(size[^5_1],0),
             origin .+ Point2f(size[^5_1],size[^5_2]), origin .+ Point2f(0,size[^5_2])]
        end for i in 1:n]
    end

    # 3. First-pass textlabel — invisible, just to trigger bbox capture
    # Uses raw positions, no offset yet
    ghost = textlabel!(p, p.positions, text=p.labels,
                       shape=spy_shapes, color=(:black, 0),
                       markerspace=:pixel, visible=false)

    # 4. Solver: lifts on bboxes + camera pixel_space
    #    Runs whenever bboxes populate OR camera changes (zoom/resize)
    solved_offsets = @lift begin
        bb = $(bboxes)
        isempty(bb) && return zeros(Point2f, length($(p.labels)))

        # Convert anchor positions to pixel space
        px_positions = Makie.project.(
            Ref($(p).parent.scene),   # or ax.scene
            $(p.positions)
        )

        # Run physics solver (pure Julia, pixel space)
        _solve_repel(px_positions, bb,
                     $(p.force_text), $(p.force_static),
                     $(p.force_pull), $(p.max_iter))
        # Returns Vec2f[] of pixel-space offsets from original anchor
    end

    # 5. Final visible textlabel — real background, solved offsets
    textlabel!(p, p.positions,
               text=p.labels,
               offset=solved_offsets,
               markerspace=:pixel,
               padding=p.padding,
               fontsize=p.fontsize,
               color=p.color)

    # 6. Connector line segments
    # Only draw when offset > min_dist
    segments = @lift begin
        offsets = $(solved_offsets)
        pos     = $(p.positions)
        thresh  = $(p.min_dist)
        # Interleave: [anchor₁, labelcenter₁, anchor₂, labelcenter₂, ...]
        # filtered by norm(offset) > thresh
        _build_segments(pos, offsets, thresh)
    end

    linesegments!(p, segments,
                  color=p.linecolor,
                  visible=p.draw_lines)

    return p
end
```


### The Solver (`_solve_repel`)

Pure Julia, no Makie dependency — easy to test in isolation:

```julia
function _solve_repel(anchors::Vector{Point2f},
                      bboxes::Dict{Int,Rect2f},
                      force_text, force_static, force_pull,
                      max_iter)
    n = length(anchors)
    offsets = zeros(Vec2f, n)

    for _ in 1:max_iter
        Δ = zeros(Vec2f, n)
        for i in 1:n
            bi = translate(bboxes[i], anchors[i] + offsets[i])

            # Repel from other labels
            for j in 1:n
                i == j && continue
                bj = translate(bboxes[j], anchors[j] + offsets[j])
                overlap = _overlap_vec(bi, bj)
                Δ[i] += force_text * overlap
            end

            # Repel from anchor points (all of them, not just own)
            for j in 1:n
                d = (anchors[i] + offsets[i]) - anchors[j]
                nd = norm(d)
                nd < 1f-6 && continue
                Δ[i] += force_static * d / nd^2
            end

            # Attract to own anchor
            Δ[i] -= force_pull * offsets[i]
        end
        offsets .+= Δ
    end
    return offsets
end
```


***

## Does SpecApi / Declarative Figure Work?

Yes, with a caveat. SpecApi (`Makie.SpecApi`) introduced in v0.20 lets you describe plots as specs (`PlotSpec`) that Makie diffs and updates. You can do:[^5_3]

```julia
# Declarative-style
fig = Figure()
obs_data = Observable((positions, labels))
spec = @lift Makie.PlotSpec(:TextRepel, $(obs_data)[^5_1], $(obs_data)[^5_2])
plot!(fig[1,1], spec)
```

When `obs_data` updates, Makie diffs the spec and **reuses the plot object if the type matches** rather than destroying and rebuilding it. The reactive solver chain inside the recipe then fires naturally.[^5_3]

The catch: SpecApi's diff logic updates *attributes*, but your bbox spy requires a **first-render pass** to populate. This is fine for static figures, but if `obs_data` changes significantly (new number of labels), the ghost `textlabel!` needs to re-fire. You'd handle this by including the label count in the Observable dependency chain so the bbox store is invalidated and rebuilt on structural changes.

***

## Key Open Questions Before You Write Code

1. **When exactly does the spy shape callback fire in each backend?** CairoMakie is synchronous (immediate on `display`); GLMakie is asynchronous (deferred to GPU render loop). You may need `on(events(scene).tick)` to know when the first frame has rendered in GLMakie before reading captured bboxes.
2. **Is `Makie.project` stable API?** It's used internally but not documented as public. Worth checking `Makie.to_ndim` and `Makie.project` signatures across v0.21–0.24.
3. **Connector line clipping.** ggrepel clips the segment to the label box edge (not center). Worth deciding early if you want geometric edge intersection or just center-to-anchor.

# Great thanks!

You're welcome! You've got a solid foundation to work from — the spy-shape bbox capture is a clever way to stay on public API, and modeling the solver as a pure Observable transformation means zoom/resize reactivity comes for free.

When you're ready to start coding, the natural first milestone would be getting the bbox spy working in isolation on a simple `textlabel!` call before wiring up the full recipe. Good luck with it — would be a genuinely useful package for the Julia plotting ecosystem.

---

# Is there a naming convention for Makie extension packages?

There's no enforced convention, but there's a clear **de facto community pattern**: packages providing Makie recipes or visualizations use the suffix `**Makie.jl`**. Examples from the ecosystem:[^7_1]

- `GraphMakie.jl`
- `GeoMakie.jl`
- `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` (exception — more of a full DSL)
- `TidierPlots.jl` (exception — branded after TidierData)

For a standalone recipe package like yours, `MakieRepel.jl` or `RepelMakie.jl` would both fit the pattern. `MakieRepel.jl` front-loads the ecosystem context (useful for discoverability), while `RepelMakie.jl` mirrors the `GraphMakie`/`GeoMakie` style more closely.

One structural note from the Makie recipe docs: if you later want to embed this as a **weak dependency extension** inside another package (e.g., someone's bioinformatics package wants repelled scatter labels without mandating Makie), the pattern is to stub out `textrepel` and `textrepel!` as empty functions in the main package and implement the `@recipe` body in a `MakieExtension` module inside `ext/`. That architecture is worth designing for from the start even if you initially ship it as a standalone package.[^7_1]

# By the way, is there an opportunity to use pretext.js like computation here?

Great lateral thought — but I think you mean **[Penner easing / physics simulation]** or possibly **Preact**? "pretext.js" isn't a library I recognize in this context. Could you clarify what you're thinking of?

A few possibilities you might mean:

- **`d3-force`** — the canonical JS force-directed simulation used in D3.js, which is exactly the physics model ggrepel's C++ implements. There's prior art porting this to Julia.
- **`Observables.jl` + `JSServe.jl`** — if you're thinking of offloading the solver to a JS runtime in WGLMakie's browser context, where you could call a JS physics library directly
- **A specific text layout library** — there are a few JS ones (e.g., `labella.js` for timeline label placement) that use different algorithms than force-simulation

If you're thinking of running JS-side computation to handle the bbox/solver loop for the WGLMakie backend specifically — that's actually an interesting architecture worth exploring, since WGLMakie already runs in a browser where you have access to the DOM's `getBoundingClientRect()` for true rendered text metrics. That would solve the "measure before physics" problem completely, at the cost of backend-specific code.

What were you thinking of?

---

# I mean this: [https://github.com/chenglou/pretext](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext)

Oh, this is a genuinely interesting idea — and a sharp one. Let me think through it carefully.

## What Pretext Does

Pretext is a pure JS/TS text measurement and layout library that **avoids DOM layout reflow** entirely. The key insight: it uses `canvas.measureText()` as its font-metric ground truth, then does all line-breaking, wrapping, and segment measurement as pure arithmetic on cached widths. The `prepare()` / `layout()` split is exactly the "measure once, compute many times" pattern you'd want for a solver.[^9_1]

## The Opportunity

For **WGLMakie specifically**, this is a real opportunity. WGLMakie runs in a browser context where you have access to a Canvas 2D context. Pretext's `prepare()` would give you:

- Accurate per-label `maxLineWidth` and `height` in pixels — no DOM reflow, no async timing issues
- This runs **synchronously, before any Makie rendering** — solving the bootstrap problem entirely
- Correct multiline label handling for free (if your labels wrap)

The architecture shift it enables:

```
1. In JS (before plot renders):
   labels.map(text => {
     const prep = prepare(text, '12px Inter')  // canvas measureText, cached
     const { maxLineWidth } = measureLineStats(prep, Infinity)
     return { width: maxLineWidth + 2*padding, height: lineHeight + 2*padding }
   })
   → send bboxes to Julia via JSServe/Bonito observable

2. In Julia:
   on(bboxes_from_js) do bboxes
     offsets = _solve_repel(px_positions, bboxes, ...)
     plot positions updated
   end
```


## The Real Constraint

The catch: **fonts must match**. Pretext's measurements are only accurate if you pass the exact same font spec that Makie uses to render the text. WGLMakie uses FreeType for text rendering, not the browser's font engine — so `canvas.measureText('label', '12px Inter')` may not match what WGLMakie actually renders, especially for kerning and glyph advances.[^9_1]

This is the same font-mismatch problem that causes `string_boundingbox` to occasionally return NaN in edge cases. You'd need to either:

- Force WGLMakie to use a web-safe font and pass the same spec to Pretext, or
- Accept ~5% measurement error (probably fine for label repulsion)


## Verdict

It's a compelling architecture for a **WGLMakie-specific fast path** — Pretext gives you synchronous, reflow-free, pre-render bbox measurement that sidesteps the entire spy-shape bootstrap problem. The font-mismatch is real but probably tolerable for a label repel use case where you just need approximate extents, not typographic precision.

The cleanest design: use Pretext for WGLMakie (JS path), and fall back to the spy-shape approach for CairoMakie/GLMakie (Julia path). One solver, two measurement backends, selected by backend type.

# What if I port the engine to Julia?

Now I have a clear picture of what pretext actually does. Here's the honest assessment:

## What Pretext's Engine Actually Is

Pretext has two distinct components:[^10_1][^10_2]

1. **`prepare()` — the hard part**: Segments text using `Intl.Segmenter` for Unicode-aware word boundaries, then measures each segment's pixel width via `canvas.measureText()`. This is what gives it browser-accurate metrics. The cache is the expensive call (~0.1–1ms).
2. **`layout()` — the trivial part**: Walks the cached segment widths, sums them against a container width, counts line breaks, multiplies by `lineHeight`. Pure arithmetic. ~0.0002ms per call.[^10_1]

## The Port Question

The `layout()` phase is trivially portable to Julia — it's just integer arithmetic over a width array. That's maybe 30 lines of Julia and not interesting on its own.

The `prepare()` phase is the entire value proposition, and **it is fundamentally a thin wrapper around `canvas.measureText()`**. That function is a read-only hook into the browser's font shaping engine — HarfBuzz under the hood in most browsers. Pretext doesn't reimplement glyph shaping; it delegates to the platform. This is both why it's accurate and why it's ~15KB rather than megabytes.[^10_3]

**Julia already has the equivalent.** Makie uses FreeType.jl + HarfBuzz.jl for font shaping. `Makie.string_boundingbox(GlyphCollection)` is exactly `canvas.measureText()` — a read-only hook into FreeType/HarfBuzz without triggering a full render. The `layout_text()` → `string_boundingbox()` pipeline *is* the Julia port of `prepare()`.

## The Real Insight Though

What pretext *does* demonstrate that's worth stealing is the **architectural discipline**: treat measurement as a pure data transformation that produces a cache, then treat layout as a pure function over that cache. In Julia terms:

```julia
# "prepare" equivalent — call once per label set
struct TextMetrics
    width  :: Float32
    height :: Float32
end

function measure_labels(labels, fontsize, font) :: Vector{TextMetrics}
    # layout_text + string_boundingbox once per label
    # cache the results
end

# "layout" equivalent — call thousands of times in solver loop
function _solve_repel(anchors, metrics::Vector{TextMetrics}, ...)
    # pure arithmetic, no Makie calls inside the hot loop
end
```

The point isn't porting pretext's code — it's porting pretext's *separation of concerns*. The measurement call (expensive, Makie-dependent, called once) is fully separated from the solver loop (cheap, pure Julia, called `max_iter` times). This is exactly what makes pretext 600× faster than DOM-based layouts, and the same discipline would make your solver fast.[^10_2]

So: don't port pretext. The Julia equivalent of its core trick already exists. But steal its architectural pattern — it's the right model for your recipe.

# Hmm. The way I would do it is abstract out the measurement component into package extensions and keep the core agnostic to text measurement

## The Measurement Interface

The core only cares about this contract:

```julia
# measurement.jl — in core
struct TextMetrics
    width  :: Float32
    height :: Float32
end

# Each extension implements this
function measure_labels(
    labels   :: Vector{String},
    fontsize :: Float32,
    font,              # Makie font object or nothing
    backend          # dispatch token
) :: Vector{TextMetrics} end
```

Extensions register themselves by defining `measure_labels` for their dispatch token. The recipe calls `measure_labels(labels, fontsize, font, current_backend())` and is otherwise completely agnostic.

## Why This Is Better Than What I Sketched

Three concrete wins:

1. **Testability.** The solver and segment builder are pure functions with no Makie dependency at all. You can unit-test the physics in a plain Julia environment with `TextMetrics` constructed by hand — no display, no scene, no rendering.
2. **Backend extensibility without touching core.** Someone could add a `PangoMeasurement.jl` extension for GTK-native measurement, or a `SkiaMeasurement.jl` for Skia-backed backends, without touching `solver.jl` at all.
3. **The fallback extension is genuinely useful.** A monospace estimate (`width ≈ fontsize * 0.6 * nchars`, `height ≈ fontsize * 1.2`) is wrong but fast and requires zero dependencies. Good enough for draft figures where you just want approximate repulsion. This is actually what `adjustText` does internally when it can't measure.

## One Design Decision to Make Early

What's the dispatch token? Three options:


| Option | Pros | Cons |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Val{:backend_name}` | Simple | Couples to string names, breaks on backend rename |
| Abstract type `AbstractMeasurementBackend` | Idiomatic Julia | Requires subtypes in each extension |
| Trait on the Makie scene object | Most correct | Makie doesn't expose a clean backend type token |

The `AbstractMeasurementBackend` subtype approach is probably right — each extension defines `struct MakieMeasurementBackend <: AbstractMeasurementBackend end` and the recipe calls `measure_labels(..., detect_backend(scene))` where `detect_backend` inspects the scene type.

## The Blind Spot Worth Flagging

`detect_backend(scene)` is the seam that could get messy. CairoMakie, GLMakie, and WGLMakie have different scene types but this isn't public API — the scene hierarchy is `Makie.Scene` in all cases, with backend-specific specialization happening at the `Screen` level, which the recipe doesn't have easy access to. You may end up needing the user to pass the backend explicitly, or inferring it from whether `JSServe` is loaded.

# Oh I meant to do this all in a different package.

Even cleaner. So the separation is:

```
TextMeasure.jl  (standalone, no Makie dependency)
├── src/
│   ├── TextMeasure.jl         # AbstractMeasurementBackend, TextMetrics, measure_labels interface
│   └── fallback.jl            # monospace estimate, zero deps
└── ext/
    ├── MakieMeasurement.jl    # weakdep: Makie — FreeType/layout_text path
    ├── WGLMeasurement.jl      # weakdep: JSServe/Bonito — canvas.measureText path
    └── FreeTypeMeasurement.jl # weakdep: FreeType.jl directly — for non-Makie use

MakieRepel.jl  (depends on TextMeasure.jl + Makie)
├── solver.jl
├── segments.jl
└── recipe.jl    # calls TextMeasure.measure_labels(...)
```

This is genuinely a better design than embedding measurement in the recipe package — `TextMeasure.jl` becomes independently useful for anyone doing text layout in Julia (axis label sizing, word wrapping, badge/chip sizing in Makie figures). It's a missing primitive in the ecosystem.

The one thing worth nailing in `TextMeasure.jl`'s public API before building on top of it: decide whether `measure_labels` returns metrics in **font units, data units, or pixels**, since each extension naturally produces different units. Pixels is probably the right canonical form — it's what the solver needs, and every backend can produce it with the right context passed in (DPI + fontsize for FreeType, devicePixelRatio for canvas).

# Would it be bad to call it Pretext.jl? Are there licensing issues? I think pretext.js is MIT

**No licensing issue** — MIT allows you to use the name, concept, and even port the code as long as you include the original copyright notice. You don't even have to do that since you're writing a clean-room implementation inspired by the architecture, not copying code.[^13_1]

The more practical question is **namespace collision and discoverability**:

- There's already a `PreTeXtBook/pretext-cli` project (an academic math publishing toolchain)  — unrelated, but it means "pretext" has some prior associations in technical communities[^13_2]
- `chenglou/pretext` is a JS library, so there's no Julia package conflict to worry about
- Searching "Pretext.jl" on Julia's package registry shows nothing registered

**`Pretext.jl` is a reasonable name** if your intent is to be a Julia spiritual successor to chenglou's library — same core idea (fast, reflow-free text measurement), same architectural separation of concerns, different ecosystem. The name clearly signals intent to someone who knows the JS original.

The one honest concern: pretext.js's value proposition leans heavily on `canvas.measureText()` as the accuracy source. Your `Pretext.jl` would use FreeType/HarfBuzz instead, which is actually *more* correct (not browser-dependent). That's worth calling out in the README — "inspired by pretext.js, same philosophy, uses FreeType rather than canvas."
